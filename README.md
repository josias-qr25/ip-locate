This is a simple Python program that retrieves geolocation data from an IP address using API.\
You will need python3 installed and the requests library (pip install requests).

A beneficial use for this program is the ability to locate server locations and identify potential scam links.\
For example. if a link is sent to you pretending to be a highway toll invoice, do not open the link! Highway toll invoices are not sent through text! Instead type the link into this program to see where that website server is being hosted. Sunpass in Florida is hosted in the United States by Incapsula Inc. so if you retieve a location in Russia from the link sent, just ingore and report the text.\\

Stay safe out there!
